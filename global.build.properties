# Annotation File Utilities project
# Global properties file that contains absolute paths to all known projects.

# This file must contain absolute paths for each project.
# Environment variables can be used, but must be enclosed in brackets
# and prefixed with 'env.' as such: ${env.PATH}

# ${workspace} contains the top-level checkouts.

# If this property file is included from elsewhere, ${workspace} should
# already be defined (and hopefully to an absolute pathname, such as by
# starting with ${basedir}); in that case, this definition has no effect.
